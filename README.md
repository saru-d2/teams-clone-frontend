Made with <span style="color: #e25555;">&hearts;</span> in India by [saru](https://github.com/saru-d2)

## Instructions to run

### Prerequisites -

- node

After installing node, run the following commands to initialize the project.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saru-d2/teams-clone-frontend.git
    cd teams-clone-frontend
    npm install
    npm start
```

Additionally you might want to build the backend also, which you can find [here](https://github.com/saru-d2/teams-clone-backend). In which case you may need to change [config.jsx](src/config.js) to use your local backend.

Then visit the page at http://localhost:3000

You could also visit the static version of the website [here](https://saru-d2.github.io/react-clone-frontend)
